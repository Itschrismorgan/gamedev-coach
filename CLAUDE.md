# gamedev-coach — project guide

This repo is a **Claude plugin marketplace** of Socratic game-design skills. Each skill coaches a designer through one phase of pre-production (the work that happens *before* writing code) by asking focused questions and producing a concrete artifact.

The skills are intended for a college-level game-design student — someone with strong ideas who needs help focusing and driving a real process forward. Treat the designer as a serious peer learning the craft.

## Current status / next action (pick up here)

The marketplace and the first two skills (`game-concept`, `game-pillars`) are **built and pushed to GitHub** at https://github.com/Itschrismorgan/gamedev-coach (branch `main`).

Next build is the **`game-core-loop`** skill (phase 3 — see the pipeline table below). `game-pillars` already hands off to it.

**Pipeline shape (decided):** linear *with loop-backs* — a later phase can send the designer back to revise an earlier artifact (e.g. `game-scope` reopening `game-pillars`). Every skill from phase 2 on must therefore handle two entry states (fresh vs. revisit), point its handoff both forward and back, and write to a **revision trail** in its artifact. Scope stays at phase 5 (it's the reality gate that triggers loop-backs); the pipeline stays at five phases. The re-entry + loop-back pattern is established in `game-pillars` — follow it.

To validate and test the live marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
/plugin marketplace add Itschrismorgan/gamedev-coach
/plugin install game-design@gamedev-coach
```

After adding a new skill, bump `version` in `plugin.json` (and the marketplace entry if pinned), commit, and push; installed users update via `/plugin marketplace update`.

Decisions already made: repo name `gamedev-coach`; **one plugin** (`game-design`) containing every phase skill, so users install once and get the whole pipeline.

## The pipeline (roadmap)

Pre-production moves a fuzzy idea toward a spec concrete enough to prototype. Each skill owns one phase and hands off to the next.

| Phase | Skill | Owns the question | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1. Concept | `game-concept` | What is this game, and who's it for? | ✅ Built |
| 2. Pillars | `game-pillars` | What must always be true about it? (2–4 commitments) | ✅ Built |
| 3. Core loop | `game-core-loop` | What does the player repeat, second to second? | 🔜 Next |
| 4. GDD | `game-gdd` | The living spec — systems, controls, progression, scope | 🔜 Planned |
| 5. Scope | `game-scope` | Is this buildable in the time available? | 🔜 Planned |

`game-pillars` already hands off to `game-core-loop`, so that's the natural next build.

## Design philosophy (apply to every skill)

These principles are what make the skills work. Keep them consistent across the pipeline.

1. **Drive forward by asking questions.** The skill is a coach, not a form or a scribe. It interrogates the idea so the designer sees it more clearly than before.

2. **One question at a time.** Ask a single question, then stop and wait. Never stack questions. The rhythm — question, answer, reflect, sharpen, next — is the whole point. This is a hard rule.

3. **Be Socratic.** Mirror answers back in crisper words; push on vagueness; name scope creep and "park" tangents without losing them; prefer one concrete moment over abstractions; reward specificity.

4. **Help the designer converge.** The student's failure mode is carrying ten half-ideas. Every skill should narrow and sharpen rather than expand.

5. **Peer-level voice.** Real design vocabulary (player fantasy, core verb, core loop, comparables, MDA), defined briefly the first time. No dumbing down, no lecturing.

6. **End with an artifact + handoff.** Every completed session saves a markdown doc to the designer's working folder (using a template in the skill's `assets/`) and points explicitly to the next phase skill and why it matters.

## How to author a new phase skill

1. Create `plugins/game-design/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Frontmatter needs `name` and a **pushy, trigger-rich `description`** — list the phrases a designer would actually say, and state when it should fire (and that it follows the previous phase). Undertriggering is the main risk.
3. Body: short framing, then the Socratic interview flow for that phase (a path, not a rigid script), a convergence/synthesis step, an artifact-save step, and a handoff to the next phase.
4. Add a fill-in template under that skill's `assets/`.
5. Bump `version` in `plugin.json` (and the marketplace entry if pinned) so installed users receive the update.
6. `claude plugin validate .`, commit, push. Users get it via `/plugin marketplace update`.

Reference: the `game-concept` skill is the pattern to follow. The official skill-authoring guidance lives in the `skill-creator` skill if you want to run evals on triggering accuracy.
